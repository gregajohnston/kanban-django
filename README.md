# Introduction

This module creates a to-do list database that the user can edit. The subsequent data is parsed and simple weather information is displayed. The module runs from the command line and outputs all results there.

## Requirements

All required files are listed in the *requirements.txt* file. To run, type "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your OS command line. There are no other files needed to install to make the program work, simply copy all of the contents into a directory and type `python manage.py runserver` at the command line prompt. The program then requires you to open a web browser to **localhost:8000**.

## Files

Included in this module are: README.md; requirements.txt; manage.py; and two directories (tasks and kanban) that contain the django database and supporting files.

`manage.py` is the main file, and is the only file that should be run. All of the remaining .py files, located in the subdirectories, are modules that run when server is running.
